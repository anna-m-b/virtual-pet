# Virtual Pet -  a JavaScript project

At bootcamp, we are learning about **OOP** in JavaScript. To help us grasp these concepts our task is to build a **virtual pet**. I'm feeling nostalgic for my old tamagotchi now.

We are also learning **TDD**. This project will come with a full test suite written in **Jest**.

### How can you interact with this virtual pet?

- [x]  You can give them a name
- [x]  They can get older
- [x]  As they get older, they get hungrier and less fit
- [x]  You can walk your pet to increase its fitness. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- [x]  You can feed your pet to decrease its hunger. üçï
- [x]  You can talk to your pet to see if it needs feeding or walking
- [x]  If your pet gets too hungry or unfit, it will DIE üíÄ
- [x]  If your pet gets to 30 days old it will DIE üò¢
- [x]  Your pet can have babies

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites
If you'd like to play with your very own JavaScript pet, you'll need Node.js installed on your machine.
First, check if you already have Node.js and npm installed. Open your terminal and run:

      node -v
      npm -v

If you get something like 'v14.7.0' and '6.14.7' congratualtions! You already have node and npm.
If not, jump to [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) and download Node.js from there (npm is bundled with it).


### Installing
Once you have Node.js, fork this repo then clone your forked version onto your machine.

In the project directory in terminal run `npm i`. This will install the project dependencies on your machine. In this case, that means Jest, which we use for testing.

### Create a pet
In your terminal, in the project directory, enter into the node REPL by running the command `node`.

The first thing you need to do is import the index.js file. Enter the following in your terminal:

`$ const { Pet } = require('./src/index.js')`

Now you're ready to create your pet! You can do this as below, replacing both instances of 'yourPetName' with the name you want to call your pet. 

`$ const yourPetName = new Pet('yourPetName')`

Enter yourPetName into the terminal and you should see:

      {
      name: 'yourPetName',
      age: 0,
      hunger: 50,
      fitness: 50,
      children: [],
      availableMethods: [ 'start(dayLength)', 'walk()', "feed('carrot')", "feed('treat')", 'checkUp()', 'haveBaby('name')' ]
      }

Your pet will die if
- it reaches 30 days old
- its hunger level reaches 100
- its fitness level falls to 0


To set things in motion we need to call start and pass in a time in milliseconds (minimum is 5000) that will set the length of a day. For example:

`$ yourPetName.start(20000)`

Each day cycle will now be 20 seconds. Every 20 seconds your pet will get 1 point older, 5 points hungrier and 5 points less fit.

To prevent your pet getting hungry and unfit, you can walk and feed your pet as shown in the avaiableMethods property. You can also see how your pet is doing and get a hint as to what it might need by calling checkUp:

`$ yourPetName.checkUp()`

Example output: `"I'm getting peckish, how about a snack? Also, I'm restless, let's go for a walk!"`

Try walking and feeding your pet. How does it respond?

Pets can also have babies. Just run:

`$ yourPetName.haveBaby('babyName')`

Then, check:

`$ yourPetName.children`

You should see an array containing your pet's new baby! Congratulations on your expanding family.

## Running the tests 
Open up the project directory in your favourite code editor. Take a look in the tests directory to see all the tests written for the virtual pet code so far. They're grouped into 3 describe blocks, one for the constructor, one for the prototype and one for an instance of Pet.

In your terminal run:

`$ npm t`

Look at all those green ticks! So satisfying!
